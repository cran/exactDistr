	0.2-4 (05.12.2000)

	typos fixed, system.file()[1] in examples 

	0.2-3 (04.12.2000)

	uhh, 0.2-2 was buggy :-(
	bugs (hopefully) fixed, more intelligent determination of the
	factor to multiply real (!) valued scores with. It is now possible
	to give a maximum error by "tol" on the quantile scale. Default is 
	tol = 0.01 which should be ok for most situations. 

	0.2-2 (29.11.2000)

	rational scores now possible -> this results in an approximation
	only. Can be influenced by "fact".

	0.1-9 (25.10.2000)

	bugfixes for pperm(paired): 0 is a possible realization

	0.1-8 (24.10.2000)

	added the paired sample situation, now ./inst/test1.R for the
	comparison with [pq]signrank, ./inst/test2.R with  [pq]wilcox

	0.1-7 (23.10.2000)

	bug fixes (H as double), test.R in ./inst for testing with
	[pq]wilcox

	0.1-6 (22.10.2000)

	hacked cpermdist in C, now computations a lot faster
